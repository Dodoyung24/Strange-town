;Whole script is ofc based on faxis macro
;Used some features of the ainz macro (random stages for my other macro, used his gui for this one as well)
;auto update from keira (mine is cracked, works somehow)


;tut

;Set everything in settings like in the base faxi macro
;depending on if you matchmake, take a hybrid on your first slot (especially if you play alone)
;Set the stage to whatever stage you want (recommend fourth stage ofc)
;Movement could be kinda cracked btw when walking to the raid portal 
;Ingame, i set the placement range to go into one line (you can place like 8 units there) > Change that if you want the units to be placed somewhere else, open the macro, press ctrl + f, search "step" and there should be 4 numbers with startX, StartY, endX, EndY or something like that
;They define on which part of the screen the placement starts and goes to so change that if you want
